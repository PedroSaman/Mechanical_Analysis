# Nano-Block 3D Printing â€“ YNU Research Internship

## Overview
This repository documents my research internship at **Yokohama National University (YNU)**, where I explored **3D printing using nano-blocks** (Lego-like modular components).  
The project focused on demonstrating **robot-agnostic modular printing**, showing that the method can be applied across different robotic platforms, and capturing **live printing processes** as proof of concept.

---

## Project Goals
- Show that nano-block printing can work with multiple robot types.
- Demonstrate the live assembly and printing process.
- Explore applications in education, rapid prototyping, and modular design.
- Document the workflow for research dissemination.
