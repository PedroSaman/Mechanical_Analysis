# Nano-Block 3D Printing – YNU Research Internship

## Overview
This repository documents my research internship at **Yokohama National University (YNU)**, where I explored **3D printing using nano-blocks** (Lego-like modular components).  
The project focused on demonstrating **robot-agnostic modular printing**, showing that the method can be applied across different robotic platforms, and capturing **live printing processes** as proof of concept.

---

## Project Goals
- Show that nano-block printing can work with multiple robot types.
- Demonstrate the live assembly and printing process.
- Explore applications in education, rapid prototyping, and modular design.
- Document the workflow for research dissemination.

## Video Demonstrations

### 1. **Types of Robots Used**
*Overview of different robots I worked with, emphasizing that the nano-block printing approach does not depend on a specific robot model.*

## How to View Videos
- In GitHub’s web interface, `.webm` files won’t autoplay inline — you’ll need to click and view them in a separate tab.
- If you open this README locally (in VS Code, a browser, or your portfolio site), the videos will play directly inside the page.
