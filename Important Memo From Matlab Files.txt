Here I am going to write all possible "problems" that I found while revising the files.
format: File Name| Problem| Solution Suggestion

Support_Block_Strategy| This strategy only tries to insert support pillars bellow or the blocks directly bellow the block being inserted| Try to look for more places to insert support pillars.

Rearrange Strategy| I decided to execute this in advance for each layer to search for possibly better initial layer layout. But this could be changed to be executed only if a block is unstable and by trying to change the order of insertion around the block that had the low capacity. The problem is that if this is done, the assembly checking would need to be done again for all blocks in the layer, as if the block order change, all blocks around the change will need to be checked again
