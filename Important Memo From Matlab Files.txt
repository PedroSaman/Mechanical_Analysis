Here I am going to write all possible "problems" that I found while revising the files.
format: File Name| Problem| Solution Sugestion

Inequality_Matrices_Assembler| Line 28 not optimal usage of sparse matrix| Tried but could't do the optmal way

Equality_Matrices_Assembler| Lines 23,25,27,29,32,34,36,38,42 not optimal usage of sparse matrix| Tried but could't do the optmal way

Subassembly_Strategy| I did not implement how to handle with an error occurs. That way, in the nested execution of NewPlaner, if a subassembly can't be assembled, it will correctly generate the error message, but without much insights on where it went wrong| Try to index better the error messages to say in which subassembly or global block the insertion could't not be done.

Support_Block_Strategy| This strategy only tries to insert support pillars bellow or the blocks directly bellow the block being inserted| Try to look for more places to insert support pillars.

Support_Block_Strategy| The way how I defined support_coordinates variable, makes it nonoptmial due increasing size every loop| If possible, prealocate this matrix with the maximum size and after clean it

Search_Blocks| In this function I define the maximum number of knobs a block can have is 16 (2x8 block) mannualy. That way, if new bigger blocks are desired,
